<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am **Gu Jiaze (È°æÁ®ºÊ≥Ω)**, a master's student in Artificial Intelligence at Xidian University, supervised by the IPIU Key Laboratory of the Ministry of Education. I received my B.E. degree in Computer Science and Technology from Lanzhou University of Technology in 2023. My current research focuses on open-vocabulary and multimodal remote sensing object detection, especially in tasks like small object detection and rotated bounding boxes. I have published as first author and corresponding author in top-tier journals such as **IEEE J-STARS** and **Remote Sensing**.

My research interests include:
- Multimodal and open-vocabulary object detection
- Remote sensing image understanding
- Lightweight and efficient deployment on edge devices
